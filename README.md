This project demonstrates my skills in SQL analysis, data visualization, and problem-solving. I utilized Google Colab to extract insights from a dataset, creating report to communicate findings effectively.
My project involves analyzing student data using SQL queries in a Google Colab environment.

Here's a breakdown:

Data Acquisition: I import a dataset containing student information, including names, contact details, enrollment date, activity involvement, and scores.
Database Setup: Using sqlite3, I create a database called stdata.db within your Colab environment and load the student data into a table named stdata.
Data Exploration and Analysis: I then perform various SQL queries on this data to answer specific questions:
Retrieving basic student information (e.g., contact numbers, names).
Manipulating text data (e.g., converting to lowercase, extracting substrings, creating email IDs).
Filtering data based on specific conditions (e.g., students with last names starting with 'S').
Aggregating data (e.g., calculating total scores and participant counts for activities).
Overall, My project demonstrates the use of SQL and Python (with libraries like pandas and sqlite3) for data analysis within a Colab notebook. You explore the dataset, transform data, and extract meaningful insights using SQL, making it a valuable example of data manipulation and analysis techniques.
